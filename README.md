Dashboard Study – Census Population Analysis of Australia (1996–2016)
This Power BI project analyzes Australian census data from 1996 to 2016, focusing on population growth, gender distribution, and regional variations.
The objective is to understand demographic changes across time, geography, and gender while enabling flexible trend-based exploration through interactive slicers.

Dashboard 1 Summary – Population Distribution Overview
This dashboard contains three core visualizations offering a comprehensive look at population dynamics across multiple categories:

Population by Age Group – Displays the population distribution across different age brackets, helping to observe how specific age segments have grown or declined over time.

Population Growth by State (Over the Years) – Illustrates the changes in population across Australian states from 1996 to 2016.

Gender-wise Population Growth (Over the Years) – Highlights how male and female population trends have evolved nationally.

All visuals are supported with slicers for year, gender, and state, allowing users to easily study specific population segments or regions.

Dashboard 2 Summary – Country-wise Growth Analysis
This dashboard focuses on population growth across countries, presenting three distinct analyses to compare global and regional trends:

Overall Population Growth (by Country) – Depicts how population levels have changed in each country over the study period.

Gender-based Population Growth (by Country) – Differentiates population trends by gender to show how male and female populations have grown across regions.

Growth Intensity Visualization – Uses color intensity and data ranges to visually represent the magnitude of population growth per country.

All charts are equipped with interactive slicers for filtering time periods and countries, enabling trend identification and comparative insights.

Dashboard 3 Summary – Migration and Trend Analysis
The final dashboard explores factors influencing population trends, such as migration and demographic shifts.
Identifies countries showing steady growth, rapid incline, or decline. Analyzes possible reasons behind growth changes, for instance, migration contributing to increased population.
Designed to help pinpoint regions with notable population behavior patterns over time.

Key Features
-Time-based trend analysis (1996–2016) for both national and international comparisons.
-Interactive slicers for dynamic filtering by year, gender, and location.
-Comprehensive visual storytelling across demographic, regional, and behavioral perspectives.

Dashboard Study – Screen Time, Stress, and Lifestyle Patterns
This Power BI project focuses on the relationship between screen time, stress levels, sleep hours, physical activity, age, gender, and mental health status.
The objective is to study lifestyle and digital behavior patterns that influence stress and well-being among different demographic groups.

Dashboard Page 1 Summary
This page contains four major visualizations that together present an overview of screen time behavior and wellness patterns across multiple dimensions.

Visualization 1: Average Age vs Average Screen Time (by Gender)
Highlights that elderly female users record the highest average screen time, while younger male users show the lowest.Useful for identifying demographic groups with excessive digital exposure.

Visualization 2: Average Screen Time vs Stress Level (Across All Ages)
Displays how screen time increases slightly with stress levels. Helps understand the behavioral correlation between digital usage and stress.

Visualization 3: Average Sleep Hours and Physical Activity Hours by Mental Health Status
Shows that individuals with excellent mental health tend to have better sleep and higher physical activity. In contrast, those reporting poor mental health record lower averages for both metrics.

Visualization 4: Average Age and Average Sleep Hours by Gender and Stress Level
Combines age and sleep data across genders to study how stress level affects sleep. Reveals that users with high stress levels consistently have reduced sleep hours.
All visuals include slicers for gender, stress level, and mental health status, enabling flexible and interactive exploration.

Dashboard Page 2 Summary – Screen Time vs Gender and Mental Health Status
This page focuses on analyzing screen time patterns by gender and mental health status, further segmented by whether the respondent reports stress (Yes/No).
Each panel compares Average Screen Time Hours and Maximum Age across four mental health categories — Excellent, Fair, Good, and Poor. The data reveals a subtle but clear trend:
-Screen time tends to remain slightly higher for users with lower mental health ratings.
-Both male and female groups show similar consistency, but females with stress (“Yes”) record a marginally higher average screen time compared to others.

The visualization helps in understanding how digital habits differ with perceived mental health and stress acknowledgment.

Key Insights
-Elderly female users show the highest screen exposure overall.
-High stress correlates with increased screen time and reduced sleep hours.
-Good mental health is generally associated with balanced screen habits, sufficient sleep, and higher activity.
-Stress acknowledgment slightly amplifies screen usage in both genders, reflecting possible coping behavior.

Additional Features

-Interactive Slicers for filtering by Gender, Stress Level, and Mental Health Status.
-Dual-axis charts for simultaneous analysis of behavioral and demographic parameters.
-Comparative storytelling layout to make interpretation simple and intuitive.

Queensland Road Crash Analysis Dashboard (2001–2023)
This Power BI (or R-based) project visualizes and analyzes road crash data from Queensland, Australia (2001–2023), focusing on crash severity, vehicle involvement, weather conditions, geographic hotspots, 
and long-term temporal trends.
The goal is to identify critical risk factors contributing to accidents and highlight regions or vehicle types most affected.

Dashboard 1 Summary – Crash Severity Over Time
This dashboard presents a stacked bar visualization showing the distribution of crash severities over the years:
-Fatal crashes
-Hospitalization cases
-Medical treatment and minor injuries
-Property damage only

It helps observe how total crashes and severity types have evolved annually, identifying trends such as spikes in severe injuries or reduction in minor incidents.

Dashboard 2 Summary – Crash Involvement by Vehicle Type
This visualization compares crash involvement by vehicle category, represented through both bars and line plots for better contrast.
Highlights the percentage share of each vehicle type (car, motorcycle, bicycle, pedestrian, etc.) in total crashes.
Reveals that motorcycles show the highest crash involvement percentage, followed by cars, emphasizing vulnerable road users. Provides an easy-to-read comparison of vehicle-type contribution to crash statistics.

Dashboard 3 Summary – Atmospheric Conditions and Crash Distribution
This dashboard focuses on the influence of weather conditions on crash occurrences.
Depicts that most crashes occur under clear weather (87.8%), suggesting driver behavior and road conditions are major contributors beyond weather factors.
Displays minor shares for raining (11.4%), fog, and smoke/dust conditions. The insight indicates that visibility and caution play a more significant role than environmental hazards alone.

Dashboard 4 Summary – Geographic Hotspot Visualization
This geospatial map dashboard identifies crash hotspots across Queensland (2001–2023).
Each point represents crash locations, color-coded by severity type (Fatal, Hospitalization, Minor Injury, etc.).
Major urban centers like Brisbane, Townsville, Cairns, and Toowoomba show the densest clusters, emphasizing high traffic exposure zones.
Useful for policy planners and road safety authorities to prioritize infrastructure improvements and enforcement zones.

Dashboard 5 Summary – Monthly Crash Trend Analysis (2001–2023)

A time-series visualization showing monthly crash counts over two decades.
Reveals seasonal fluctuations in crash rates and a notable drop after 2010, possibly due to improved road safety measures and policy interventions.
The COVID-19 period dip (2020) is also visible, showing the effect of lockdown and reduced traffic.
Ideal for analyzing policy impacts and long-term behavioral trends.

Key Insights
-Majority of crashes occur during clear weather conditions, not adverse ones.
-Motorcycles have the highest risk exposure among all vehicle types.
-Urban centers are major crash concentration zones.
-Crash frequency has declined significantly post-2010, possibly due to stricter road laws or improved public awareness.
